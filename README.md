### Secure Decentralized File Sharing System

A Web3-based secure file sharing platform using:

- AES end-to-end encryption
- IPFS for decentralized storage
- Polygon blockchain for access control
- MetaMask authentication

### Tech Stack

- React
- Solidity
- IPFS
- Polygon
- Cryptography

## Smart Contract Deployment

- Network: Polygon Amoy Testnet
- Contract Name: FileStorage
- Contract Address: 0x649c35347fE4b2AA984e5282dD0def8CF4827D5D
- Deployment Transaction: 0x3b0773097a030a066e576082c1a48edf9b1ea9672b9830aca1cb79a9b2e92c87

## Workflow

1. File encrypted using AES-256
2. Encrypted file uploaded to IPFS
3. IPFS CID stored on Polygon blockchain
4. Authorized users can retrieve CID
